                    "I've been meaning to send you these pictures but I haven't had any cell reception for days, which has been really
                    nice. I woke up on Monday morning to this view. Absolutely stunning. The evening was even more amazing with all the stars shining bright.
                    The Milky Way was clearly visible. I cried. It's breathtaking. I never imagined I would be able to experience something so beautiful, yet here I was
                    enjoying these magnificent landscapes with somebody who I love and respect so much, who also respects me. It's
                    a stark comparison from just a year ago when I was
                    fearful my depression was taking me somewhere too deep, a place I may not have been able to recover from. So, yes, I cried when I saw the
                    Grand Canyon for the first time. I creid when I saw the Milky Way vibrant and beautiful. I creid when I hiked
                    16 miles down a majestic canyon with somebody who respects and loves me. Because if I had not gotten out of that deep hole, none of this
                    would have been possible. I would have prevented myself from experiencing one of the greatest things on this world.
                    Sometimes I will struggle but let this be a reminder that those times will pass and it will be worth it."
                <p>
                    I wrote these words in a text to a friend on September 10, 2016. It was my first real trip and the start of many adventures
                    I would have with my now fiance.

            <h2>Viva Las Vegas</h2>

            <h3>A Night Out</h3>
            <article>
                <p>
                    We flew into Las Vegas, Sean had the entire trip mapped out. One night in Las Vegas then make our way down to Phoenix, AZ over the course of nine days.
                    We picked up our rental car and then dropped off our luggage at an inexpensive AirBnB we had reserved. Honestly, Las Vegas was my least favorite part about the trip.
                    We went out and walked around the casinos and visited the Stratosphere hotel. At the time, I was really excited to dress up for a night in the city
                    but it was just overshadowed by the rest of our trip. The beauty of the outdoors outshined the bright lights of the city.

            <h2>Valley of Fire</h2>
            <img src="/images/IMG_Valley.jpg" alt="Milky Way over Valley of Fire" width="500" height="700">
            <h3>The Hottest Night</h3>
            <p>
                Valley of Fire was beautiful. We did a few short hikes totalling four miles. It was our first night camping on this trip. As it got darker,
                Sean set up his camera tripod and took some nightscrape photos. He took this gorgeous photo of the Milky Way. I'm still amazed at how beautiful it was.

            <p>
                It was also insanely hot. It was so hot that my sweat evaporated before I ever could see it. It left salt deposited on my skin. It was gritty.
                Even in the dead of night, the temperature was 98 degrees. I couldn't sleep. Thankfully, this campsite had showers but it would be the
                last time I would have a chance to shower in the next five days.

            <h2>Zion National Park</h2>
            <img src="/images/IMG_0147.jpg" alt="On top of Angel's Landing" width="900" height="600">
            <h3>Angel's Landing</h3>
            <p>
                As we approached Angel's Landing by tram, the driver said, "Up next is a hike only expert hikers should attempt, many people have fallen to their death attempting this hike." He
                wasn't being hyperbolic either, at least eight people have fallen to their death attempting to hike Angel's Landing.
                It frequently shows up on Most Dangerous Hikes in the World lists, including <a href="https://www.outsideonline.com/1856636/20-most-dangerous-hikes">this article by Outside Online</a>.
            <p>
                Nonetheless, this did not stop us from attempting the hike ourselves. The first mile wasn't difficult but it become increasingly more difficult
                with each step. The last 5,790 feet has chains to assist hikers in their climb. It is imperative to use the chains to
                prevent falling but as other tourists are wiggling their way between you, it's becomes increasingly harder to hold onto the chains.
                We eventually got to the top and the view was stunning. The rock formation overlooks the Virgin River and provides
                breathtaking views of Zion.

            <img src="/images/IMG_Narrows.jpg" alt="After Narrows Hike" width="900" height="600">
            <h3>Hiking the Narrows</h3>
            <p>
                We almost didn't get to go on this hike. It requires a permit and special gear and we almost didn't have time to
                pick up our gear from the rental company. Our phones rarely got cell reception and their clocks had not had a chance to adjust
                from traveling between time zones. We had lost an hour but did not realize it. By the time we hiked down from
                Angel's Landing, it was ten minutes before 8 pm. The rental place closed at 8 pm. Thankfully, a nice
                British couple gave us a ride to the rental shop and we made it two minutes before they closed. I am forever
                thankful they gave a couple strangers a ride because the hike ended up being one of the most
                important moments of my life.
            <p>
                I have suffered from depression as long as I can remember. I know it was bad during my teenage years but then
                got worse in my twenties. I had went to therapy and made big improvements but there were still some really difficult moments before I
                started to get better. Even then, I still struggled. I didn't know what self-worth felt like. I knew it was important
                but I couldn't grasp what it would really feel like.

            <p>
                I found it on this hike.
            <p>
                We got up at 4 am, broke down our campsite, and then headed back to the rental company - before they were
                even open. By 6 am, all of our gear had been loaded into a 4x4 van along with a handful of other people. We spent
                the next two hours bouncing around in that van through the wilderness until we got to the top of the slot canyon in Zion, the Narrow.
                Sean and I geared up and started the 16 mile hike down. The first two miles was on land but the remaining
                14 miles are through the river. Within the first mile of the river, Sean lost his GoPro camera but thankfully
                never lost his professional DSLR camera. We took several breaks but it was important that we always
                kept moving so we would not have to hike in the dark down the river. We had to cross the river several times
                to avoid excessively deep parts of the river. We wore canyoneering shoes and had walking sticks to help
                keep our balance.
            <p>
                It was somewhere around mile 6 that I suddenly became overwhelmed with self-worth. I did not have anything
                else on my mind except how beautiful the canyon was. How fortunate I felt to be there. How fortunate I felt
                to be present on this Earth. I started to cry. I had never felt self worth and the feeling of it
                flooded me.
            <p>
                We completed the 16 mile hike just 11 hours. I was sore. My whole body ached but my soul
                finally felt like it was healing. That healing never stopped.

            <h2>Grand Canyon National Park - North Rim</h2>
            <img src="/images/IMG_GrandCanyon.jpg" alt="Grand Canyon" width="900" height="600">
            <h3>Breathtaking Beauty</h3>
            <p>
                We did not do very much hiking after the Narrows, we were sore for days afterwards, but we
                continued to enjoy everything the Desert Southwest had to offer. Including the North Rim of
                the Grand Canyon. Just as my opening quote states, I cried the moment I saw it. It was even
                more beautiful than I ever had imagined.
            </p>
            <h2>Grand Canyon National Park - South Rim</h2>
            <img src="/images/IMG_GrandCanyon2.jpg" alt="After Narrows Hike" width="900" height="600">
            <h3>No Showers</h3>
            <p>
                By this point, I hadn't showered in over four days. Even after all that hiking and sweating, there just wasn't any place for us to wash up. There
                was salt and sand gritty in my hair. I smelled atrocious but I barely cared. I had never felt so gross but yet
                felt so beautiful. Every time Sean looked at me, he smiled. It's easy to feel beautiful when your partner
                smiles at you like that. It's also easy to feel beautiful when the world is so beautiful.
            <p>
                This was our last night camping. It was just outside the South Rim of the Grand Canyon.
                We primarily did dispersed camping, which means camping in designated areas of National Forests.
                It's permitted for free but there's no facilities, hence no showers. After this, we continued to
                travel down to Phoenix, AZ where Sean's friend was getting married. I met one of his best friends
                for the first time after not showering for five days. They let us use their shower and we then celebrated
                with them their wedding.
