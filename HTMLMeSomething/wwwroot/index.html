                "I've been meaning to send you these pictures but I haven't had any cell reception for days, which has been really
                nice. I woke up on Monday morning to this view. Absolutely stunning. The evening was even more amazing with all the stars shining bright.
                The Milky Way was clearly visible. I cried. It's breathtaking. I never imagined I would be able to experience something so beautiful, yet here I was
                enjoying these magnificent landscapes with somebody who I love and respect so much, who also respects me. It's
                a stark comparison from just a year ago when I had to have a close friend keep my firearm for me because I was
                fearful my depression was taking me somewhere too deep, a place I may not have been able to recover from. So, yes, I cried when I saw the
                Grand Canyon for the first time. I creid when I saw the Milky Way vibrant and beautiful. I creid when I hiked
                16 miles down a majestic canyon with somebody who respects and loves me. Because if I had not gotten out of that deep hole, none of this
                would have been possible. I would have prevented myself from experiencing one of the greatest things on this world.
                Sometimes I will struggle but let this be a reminder that those times will pass and it will be worth it."
            <p>
                I wrote these words in a text to a friend on September 10, 2016. It was my first real trip and the start of many adventures
                I would have with my now fiance.
